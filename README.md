# Java Stack Route - Practice Exercise - 1

The repo consists of test cases for the following questions.

1. Write a program, which reads number of students and n grades as input (of int
   between 0 and 100, inclusive) and displays the average, minimum and maximum.Your
   program shall check for valid input. You should keep all the grades in an int[] and use a
   method for each of the computations.

 2. Write a program to list all the factorials, that can be expressed as an int (i.e., 32-bit
    signed integer). [FactorialCalculatorTest](https://github.com/Bsd15/pe2-testcases/blob/master/src/test/java/com/stackroute/pe2/FactorialCalculatorTest.java)
 3. Write a program to find all files of a folder and select only given extention fileName and
    read content of this file using byte array. [FileToByteArrayReaderTest](https://github.com/Bsd15/pe2-testcases/blob/master/src/test/java/com/stackroute/pe2/FileToByteArrayReaderTest.java)
 4. Write a program to calculate the frequency of the words in a given file. [WordFrequencyCounterTest](https://github.com/Bsd15/pe2-testcases/blob/master/src/test/java/com/stackroute/pe2/WordFrequencyCounterTest.java)
